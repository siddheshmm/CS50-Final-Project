# CS50-Final-Project

#### Description:â€‹
This is the 'Currency Converter Browser Extension'. I have used JavaScript to build the computational logic for this project, that is, using the exchange rate API to get currency data based on current value for currencies. Fetching the latest exchange rates for the selected 'from' currency. Then extracting the exchange rate for the "to" currency. I made this extension right after I completed the CS50x 2024 course and I wanted it to be of some quick help to myself and others around me. The purpose this extension serves is to quickly convert currencies while shopping on foreign websites, eliminating the need to switch tabs and run a Google search each time. So you basically just look at whatever you're surfing online, you can't quickly estimate the exact amount by current exchange rates. Hence all you gotta do is open the extension and quickly convert the amount to your desired currency and make the decision!
